## fac-project-gallery
A gallery showcasing the projects I've completed so far. This project is part of the FAC application process. The requirements were: 

* Have a section or card for each project.
* Each card should have a title, an image of your project, and a description.
* Use Flexbox to arrange the cards on the page.
* Resize cards based on screen width.
* Adapt the layout of the gallery when the browser window resizes.
* Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices.
* Have a clickable button on each card that opens and closes the description text.
